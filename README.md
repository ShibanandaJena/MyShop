# MyShop

I made a E-shop website, I used it for development of that app. {Here i am attatching the github
repo link of the project: } In that E-shop , it was a mini prototype of amazon , which had almost all
facilities like of Amazon, i.e.,
 Login/Logout page
 Variety Of products
 Product View
 Cart System(Update / delete)
 Order status
 Contact/feedback page
 Review System

All the user details will be handled by default Sql database provided by Django .In addition to it , I
added a blog panel to the E shop app , which will act as a blog website , where using admin panel , I
managed the contents of the page.
